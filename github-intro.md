___

I lead remote product development and operations teams, focusing on B2B private apps for global clients (mostly US). Trained in backend engineering at Codecademy and web/frontend development at Tripleten, I bring versatility across the full stack. My experience in SaaS operations has taught me the value of clear communication alongside technical expertise, allowing me to deliver reliable, user-focused software without sacrificing quality or simplicity.
