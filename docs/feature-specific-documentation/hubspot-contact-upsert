# HubSpot Contact Creation and Update Feature for Retool-Access

This document outlines the **HubSpot Contact Creation and Update** feature for Retool-Access. This feature is designed to automatically create or update contacts in HubSpot whenever a new contact is created in our Access API. It checks if the contact already exists in HubSpot and, if not, creates a new entry; if the contact exists, it updates relevant fields.

The following diagram illustrates the process flow for creating or updating contacts in HubSpot based on new contacts in the Access API:

## Feature Scope

The **HubSpot Contact Creation and Update** feature provides the following functionalities:

1. **Automatic Contact Sync**: When a new contact is created in the Access API, Retool uses a direct integration to check HubSpot and see if the contact’s email address already exists.
2. **Contact Creation or Update**:
   - **If No Match Found**: Retool triggers HubSpot to create a new contact with fields provided from the Access API.
   - **If Match Found**: Retool updates the existing HubSpot contact with any relevant fields.

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Access API**:
   - A new contact is created in the Access API.
2. **HubSpot Check**:
   - The Retool app, using direct integration, checks if a contact with the same email address already exists in HubSpot.
3. **New Contact Creation**:
   - If the contact does not exist in HubSpot, a new contact record is created with relevant fields using information from the Access API.
4. **Existing Contact Update**:
   - If the contact exists in HubSpot, relevant fields are updated based on the latest information from the Access API.

---

## Implementation Phases

The feature will be implemented in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Data Sync**:
   - Ensure each new contact from the Access API can trigger a check in HubSpot.
2. **Phase 2: HubSpot Integration Setup**:
   - Configure the direct HubSpot integration within Retool to check for existing contacts by email address.
3. **Phase 3: Conditional Contact Creation or Update**:
   - Implement conditional logic in Retool:
     - If no match is found, create a new contact in HubSpot.
     - If a match is found, update the existing contact’s fields.
