This document outlines the HubSpot Contact Creation and Update feature for Retool-Access. This feature is designed to automatically create or update contacts in HubSpot whenever a new contact is created in our Access API. The feature checks if the contact already exists in HubSpot and, if not, creates a new entry; if the contact does exist, it updates relevant fields.

Feature Scope

The HubSpot Contact Creation and Update feature provides the following functionalities:

	1.	Automatic Contact Sync: When a new contact is created in the Access API, it is automatically created in the Retool Database.
	2.	HubSpot Check for Existing Contact: Retool checks HubSpot to see if the contact’s email address already exists.
	3.	Contact Creation or Update:
	•	If No Match Found: Retool triggers HubSpot to create a new contact with the fields provided from the Access API.
	•	If Match Found: Retool updates the existing HubSpot contact with any relevant fields.

Step-by-Step Flow

	1.	Access API:
	•	A new contact is created in the Access API, which automatically generates a corresponding record in the Retool Database.
	2.	HubSpot Check:
	•	The Retool app triggers a HubSpot API call to check if a contact with the same email address already exists.
	3.	New Contact Creation:
	•	If the contact does not exist in HubSpot, a new contact record is created with relevant fields, using the information from the Retool Database.
	4.	Existing Contact Update:
	•	If the contact does exist in HubSpot, relevant fields are updated based on the latest information in the Retool Database.

Implementation Phases

For an iterative approach, the feature will be implemented in the following phases:

	1.	Phase 1: Initial Data Sync:
	•	Ensure that each new contact from the Access API creates a corresponding record in the Retool Database.
	2.	Phase 2: HubSpot API Integration:
	•	Set up the HubSpot API integration within Retool to check for existing contacts by email address.
	3.	Phase 3: Conditional Contact Creation or Update:
	•	Implement conditional logic in Retool:
	•	If no match is found, create a new contact in HubSpot.
	•	If a match is found, update the existing contact’s fields.
