## Feature Scope

The **HubSpot Sequence Enrollment for Expert Applications** feature provides the following capabilities:

1. **Automatic Expert Application Processing**: When a new expert application is created in the system with the **Contacted** state, it is also created in the Retool Database.
2. **HubSpot Contact Lookup**: Retool uses the HubSpot API to locate the contact associated with the expert application.
3. **Sequence Enrollment**:
   - If a matching contact is found, they are added to a predefined HubSpot sequence for follow-up.
   - The sequence remains the same for all expert applications in the **Contacted** state.

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Access API**:
   - A new expert application is created in the Access API with the **Contacted** state, triggering a corresponding record in the Retool Database.

2. **HubSpot Contact Lookup**:
   - The Retool app sends an API call to HubSpot to find the contact associated with the expert application by using the contactâ€™s email.

3. **Sequence Enrollment**:
   - Once the contact is identified in HubSpot, they are enrolled in the predefined sequence to ensure consistent follow-up and engagement.
   - If no matching contact is found in HubSpot, an error message can be logged for follow-up.

---

## Implementation Phases

For a phased approach, the feature will be implemented in the following stages:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Data Sync**:
   - Ensure that each new expert application with the **Contacted** state creates a corresponding record in the Retool Database.

2. **Phase 2: HubSpot Contact Lookup**:
   - Set up the API integration in Retool to locate the contact in HubSpot based on the email associated with the expert application.

3. **Phase 3: Sequence Enrollment**:
   - Implement the API call to enroll the contact in the predefined HubSpot sequence upon successful lookup.

4. **Phase 4: Error Handling** (Optional):
   - Configure error handling in Retool to log or notify if no matching contact is found in HubSpot.
