  <--------------------------On-demand Queries & Data Sync --------------------------->

   1. **On-demand Data Retrieval**: Accesses main database to pull recent or specific records 
      (e.g., for Companies, Contacts, Projects, Expert Requests, Consultations) into the Retool database.
   2. **Periodic Dormant Data Sync**: Identifies and moves dormant data back to the main database, 
      removing it from Retool to manage storage efficiently.

## üìã **Project Overview**

**Retool-Access** enables the Fulfillment team to manage expert requests, consultations, and profiles seamlessly within Retool. Key goals include:

- **Enhanced Data Management**: Allows the team to add custom properties like pipeline stages without impacting the main API.
- **Efficient Storage**: Retool hosts only active records, while the main database archives dormant data, optimizing Retool‚Äôs 5GB limit.
- **On-demand Retrieval**: Supports data reactivation as needed for on-the-fly requests from dormant archives.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

The **Retool-Access Diagram** illustrates the application‚Äôs data architecture, which relies on two main layers:

1. **Retool Database (5GB limit)**:
   - Stores only **active data** relevant to current projects, consultations, and expert requests.
   - Automates the syncing process to manage active and dormant records effectively.

2. **Main Database (AWS or Other)**:
   - Serves as the primary storage, hosting all historical data and archiving dormant records that exceed the Retool activity threshold.

For further architectural details, view the [Retool-Access Diagram Documentation](Docs/Retool-Access-Diagram.md).

---

## üîÑ **Data Flow**

1. **On-Demand Data Retrieval**:
   - The Fulfillment team retrieves records as needed from the main database, temporarily storing them in the Retool database.
   - Only recent and active data (approx. 5% of records) is fetched to keep storage usage within limits.

2. **Dormant Data Sync**:
   - A regular sync process (e.g., monthly) identifies and archives dormant data back to the main database.
   - This ensures Retool contains only active or recently accessed records, clearing space for new requests.

---

## üìä **Key Tables and Relationships**

- **Companies**: Associated with both **Contacts** (company representatives) and **Projects**.
- **Contacts**: Individuals representing a company, often involved in multiple projects.
- **Projects**: Main operational unit, hosting multiple **Expert Requests** for consultations.
- **Expert Requests**: Central point linking **Expert Applications**, **Consultations**, and **Tickets**.
- **Expert Applications**: Track submissions from experts for each request.
- **Consultations**: Represent active sessions linked to expert requests.
- **Tickets**: Connected to expert requests, supporting issues or inquiries.

Each table plays a critical role in the Fulfillment team‚Äôs workflow. For more in-depth information, refer to [Table Documentation](Docs/Table-Structure.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup and Usage**

1. **Setting Up Retool Database**:
   - Connect the Retool PostgreSQL database and set up data sync to pull active data on demand.
   - Configure automation to archive dormant data back to the main database periodically.

2. **Using Retool Apps**:
   - Use Retool‚Äôs UI to manage data fields such as **pipeline stages**, **consultation tracking**, and **expert application statuses**.
   - Employ on-demand queries to retrieve specific archived records as needed, avoiding storage overflows in Retool.
